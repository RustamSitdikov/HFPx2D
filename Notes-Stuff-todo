GENERAL CODE STUFF

- P1 FV utilities -> Resp. Federico
    + some google test needed

- tip -> Resp. Dmitry
- wellbore -> Resp. Dmitry

core/
    DomainMesh -> tb further testeed, more test needed
    ElasticProperties -> stable  (some cleaning to be done)
    Fluid -> stable / newtonian only so far
    InSituConditions -> needs further work for non-uniform case, some test needed
    Mesh -> somehow stable (some cleaning to be done), more tests
    SegmentData -> Stable, some unit test needed
    SimulationParameters -> Stable
    SolidProperties -> some stuff may be addded ?
    Solution -> some stuff will be added, make sure to also add things in the json output
    Sources -> stable, test

core_dev /
    SolidEvolution

ehlsolvers/
        ReynoldsP0 -> leak-off need to be added, solver with constraints need to be written
        ReynoldsP1 -> constraints, leak-off ?, currently single fracture -> needs to extend it to multiple fracs + intersecting.

elasticity/
    need to code an observation routine -> obtain stress at a point due to a DD solution (or a at a number of points).
    AssemblyDDM -> stable
    PlaneStrainInfinite -> stable
    Simplified3D -> stable

input/

    Q : keep the toml routines -> all in one folder.
    json  : we need to re-arrange the different base routines add more

Solvers/

    ModeII crack -> Federico
    HFPropagationP0-> Brice  for HF propagation, need to be extended to curving (Dmitry)
    MultiFracsSolution ->  solution class for Multistage fracturing
    MultiFracSolver -> Brice, Dmitry
    SimpleElasticBenchmarks -> tb renamed as Griffith
    need to write a simple Elastic Solver with json inputs/outputs


NOTES - Multi-HF-algo Development

Elasticity benchmark
- Simplified 3D benchmarks compared with 3D code
- 1 rectangular crack -> induced stress in the mid plane.
     - convergence tests
- 1 curved rectangular crack -> induced stress in the plane
- 2 parallel cracks
- 2 curved cracks


HF Benchmarks:
1- plane-strain case  - fractures far-apart from each other :: viscosity and toughness
todo: 2-PKN like (transition kgd-> pkn)

things to be done.

tip asymptote package
 - add leak-off tip volume

Development FracturesFrontLoop
- add leak-off

- Reynolds Multi-HF
    - width constraints (case for example when starting pumping and the pressure is below sigma_n_o)
        -> convergence on pressure increment only (if width constraint are active)

- Coupling with wellbore-flow
    - try staggered loop above the fracture front loop - try with 2 fractures
    - json inputs stuff...

- Background mesh for mat properties and in-situ conditions

- test stress jumps
- test toughness jumps
