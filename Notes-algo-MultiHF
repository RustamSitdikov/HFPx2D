NOTES - Multi-HF-algo Development

Goals:
Full Algorithm should be working by year end
First validations (plane-strain case  - fractures far-apart from each other) by early December to Total !


tip asymptote package
- simplify API
- some oscillations when starting from a state where Ki=Kic and then pumping more fluid !
- check the relaxation on tip velocity -> output velocity (factor 2 when oscillating at start )

Development FracturesFrontLoop

- we will have to pin-point the time at which the initiation criteria is first met ?
   -> see  tip asymptote problems ?   can we avoid that ?

- Elasticity Matrix add row and columns when adding elements ...
    -> write a routine

- Reynolds Multi-HF
    - width constraints (case for example when starting pumping and the pressure is below sigma_n_o)
        -> convergence on pressure increment only (if width constraint are active)

- Coupling with wellbore-flow
    - Shall we hard couple ?
