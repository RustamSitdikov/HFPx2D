NOTES - Multi-HF-algo Development

Elasticity benchmark
- Simplified 3D benchmarks compared with 3D code
- 1 rectangular crack -> induced stress in the mid plane.
     - convergence tests
- 1 curved rectangular crack -> induced stress in the plane
- 2 parallel cracks
- 2 curved cracks


HF Benchmarks:
1- plane-strain case  - fractures far-apart from each other :: viscosity and toughness
todo: 2-PKN like (transition kgd-> pkn)


things to be done.

tip asymptote package
 - add leak-off tip volume

Development FracturesFrontLoop
- add leak-off

- Reynolds Multi-HF
    - width constraints (case for example when starting pumping and the pressure is below sigma_n_o)
        -> convergence on pressure increment only (if width constraint are active)

- Coupling with wellbore-flow
    - try staggered loop above the fracture front loop - try with 2 fractures
    - json inputs stuff...

- Background mesh for mat properties and in-situ conditions

- test stress jumps
- test toughness jumps
